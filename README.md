# Algorithmic Complexity #
The challenge outline for this repository can be found [here](https://github.com/makersacademy/course/tree/master/algorithmic_complexity).

## Prerequisites ##
* Visual Studio Community 2017
* [.NET Core 2.1 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/thank-you/dotnet-sdk-2.1.500-macos-x64-installer)

## How to Use ##
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tolvic/algorithmic-complexity.git
```

2. Navigate into the AlgorithmTesting folder within the repository
```bash
cd algorithmic-complexity/AlgorithmTesting
```

3. Run the application
```bash
dotnet run
```

4. Access the program from [localhost:5001](`localhost:5001`)

5. Amend the speed test using the instructions below

### Testing an Algorithm

The application can run up to 4 tests simultaneously and compare the results on the same graph and table.

1. Navigate to the new test page

2. Pick your functions from the first four drop down menus.
![test-setup-1](public/test-setup-1.png)

3. Set the parameters of the test (i.e. array size, increment size, number of time to repeat test).
![test-setup-2](public/test-setup-2.png)

4. Click Run Test.

The results will display like below:
![test-setup-3](public/test-setup-3.png)

### Running Unit Tests ###
1. Navigate into the AlgorithmTesting.Tests folder within the repository
```bash
cd algorithmic-complexity/AlgorithmTesting.Tests
```

2. Run the unit tests using the following command
```bash
dotnet test
```

## SpeedTest Function

Pseudo code for how we anticipate this working:
```
Test(FunctionToBeTested, StartArraySize, MaxArraySize, incrementSize, NbTimesTestsRepeated){
  results = new Hash
  i = StartArraySize
  n = 1  

  for (n; while n <= NoTimesTestsRepeated; n++){

    results[i] = new Array

    for (i; while i<= MaxArraySize; i += incrementSize){
      testArray = setup(i)

      var startTime = time.now

      FunctionToBeTested(testArray)

      var timeTaken = time.now - startTime

      results[i] << timeTaken

      tearDown()
    }  
  }

  removeUpperLowerBounds()
  averageResults()
  return results;
}

setup(arraySize){
  return array(1... arraySize).shuffle
}

tearDown(){
  # If there is anything that needs tearing down after each test it would be handled here
  # possible clear memory?
}
```

Results hash will be structured as follows:
```
{
  arraySize[0]{result1, result2, ...},
  arraySize[1]{result1, result2, ...},
  arraySize[2]...
}
```

and will resemble the below prior to averaging or removing upper and lower bounds.
```
Results {
  10 => {
    0.02, 0.03, 0.02
  }
  20 => {
    0.02, 0.03, 0.02
  }
  30 => {
    0.02, 0.03, 0.02
  }
}
```

This looks like it will be useful for setting up the function in C#:

Also, the test result will show time in nanoseconds.
